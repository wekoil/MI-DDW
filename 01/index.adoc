= HW1 - Done!

I choosed website fitness007.cz for webcrawling of eshop items.

I had some problems with missing description of vendors and items so i had to wrap the code into try catch blocks. Also before each request I put a 1 second delay.

I started from website "https://www.fitness007.cz//vyrobci/" where are listed all vendors. For each vendor I select all the items they were selling and put everything in json files.

The crawl is implemented in jupyter notebook "result.ipynb", the vendors are stored in "vyrobci.json" and items in "items.json".
