= HW4 - Done!

All the information about graph can be found in jupyter notebook "src/network.ipynb".

Visualisation of the graph with max 5 actors in one movie can be found in "results/graf.pdf". But it is big to visualize and see some results.

In the results folder is graph exported in GEXF format. There can be found the small one with only 5 actors and the whole graph.

I had issues with computing centrality because it took long so i ended only with two of them.

For improvements i would like to improve the visualization of the graph in Gephi. Because it does not says anything about it.
